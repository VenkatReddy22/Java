Understanding (Easy)

    Can explain what an array is without using technical terms?
    Can explain why accessing arr[100] is instant?
    Know what 0-indexing means?
    Understand difference between array and ArrayList?

    Can identify when to use array vs ArrayList?
    Can handle edge cases (null, empty, duplicates)?
    Can explain array memory layout?

🚀 PRACTICE PROGRESSION
Phase 1: Easy (Complete these first)

1. Implement findMax() ✓
2. Implement findMin() 
3. Print array in reverse
4. Count elements > X
5. Find sum of all elements

Phase 2: Medium (Then do these)

1. Implement reverseArray() ✓
2. Implement rotateArray() ✓
3. Implement frequency map ✓
4. Check if array is sorted
5. Move all zeros to end

💡 PRO TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Tip 1: Write Code by Hand First

Before typing computer code, write solutions on paper with pen. Forces deeper thinking.
Tip 2: Trace Through Examples

For each algorithm:

Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Step 1: ...
Step 2: ...
Step 3: ... until array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Tip 3: Explain Out Loud

Talk through code as if explaining to someone. Activates different parts of brain.
Tip 4: Test Edge Cases

Test with:
- Empty array
- Single element
- All same elements
- Negative numbers
- Maximum possible values

Tip 5: Understand WHY Not Just HOW

Don't memorize solutions. Understand the logic. Then you can solve variations.
Tip 6: Use Analogies

    Array = numbered mailboxes
    O(1) = instant teleport to any house
    ArrayList = expandable parking lot
    Reverse = flip a rope at both ends
